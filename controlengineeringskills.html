        <b>Modelling</b><br> 
        <br>
        <b>DC Motors:</b><br>
        Electrical Sub systems:<br>
        Mechanical Sub systems:<br> 
        Take La Place transform of both sides to solve these equations for transfer functions.<br>
        <br>
        Hydraulic Systems:<br>
        Rate of Flow which is a parameter of hydraulic valves.<br>                                      
        Flow Leakage, another parameter of hydraulic valves.<br>                                    
        Compressibility flow, and attribute of the fluid.<br>                        
        Motor Torque, the turning force of a hydraulic motor.<br>                                    
        Power, hydraulic systems power.<br>                                                  
        Develop desired transfer functions by taking La Place transform of these equations.<br>
        <br>
        Transfer function zeros and poles and their effects on system stability.<br>
        <br>
        Optimal Control (Linear Quadratic Regulator) which is a control systems that takes into account cost functions or operate within specified constraints.<br>
        <br>
        Kalman filters, way for control systems to deal with noise in the measurement systems.<br>
        <br>
        Model Predictive Control, these are control systems that specify a control for a future period instead for every step.<br>
        <br>
        Diesel Engine Management Systems regulate engine emissions, fuel consumption, engine torque and power, and external systems like dynamic stability control, driveability, and health diagnostics for servicing engines.<br>
        <br>
        Failure Mode and Effects Analysis is basically performed to reduce occurrence of failures in the systems and their severity.<br>
