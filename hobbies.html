            I play football but I don’t have a team which I could join. I am an Arsenal fan. I 
            Also like politics and economics. I consider myself to be a liberal economic
            If that is what I have to classify myself as.<br>
            <br>
            I also like travelling where I've never been before and sightseeing. For me 
            some of the best places in the world I've been to are where people are easy to
            talk to and relaxed in general. I would like to learn French, Spanish and German 
            (not necessarily in that order) if the chance would present itself.<br>
            <br>
            I’m not an extremist Christian but I am spiritual. I believe that God has put us 
            on earth, at this place, at this particular time for a reason and finding out 
            what that reason is would give us the greatest satisfaction of fulfilment.
