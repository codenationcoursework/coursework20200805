            <p>I did my M.Sc. in control systems engineering at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (https://www.ntnu.edu/).<br>
                <br>    
                In the UK I have worked  in the field of control systems development within the UK automotive industry. (mostly as a subcontractor).<br><br>                
                I have worked with major automotive companies such as Jaguar, Ford Motor Company as well as
                other second tier automotive companies such as Delphi Diesel Systems, Visteon and Pi
                Technologies.<br>
                <br>                
                My main responsibilities involved the development of engine management systems in both
                systems and software departments.<br>
                <br>                
                However I’m looking to develop my career in IT. In this regard I’ve had training in Web development at Code Nation.<br>
                <br>                
                I’m separated from my wife and going through a divorce process. I’m a Norwegian citizen but born in Uganda’s capital, Kampala. I have to tell you that I’ve been out of work for
                Two years and that has had an effect on my memory on my expertise.
